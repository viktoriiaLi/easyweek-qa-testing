# Business Risks

This document describes key business risks related to incorrect or unstable behavior of the EasyWeek booking system.

## 1. Loss of revenue due to missing upsell opportunities
If the system does not support or encourage additional service recommendations during the booking process, the average order value may decrease. Unlike phone-based booking, there is no administrator interaction to upsell extra services.

## 2. Double booking of the same time slot
System errors may allow multiple clients to book the same service and time slot, leading to schedule conflicts, customer dissatisfaction, and loss of trust.

## 3. Booking incompatible services at the same time
A client may book multiple services that cannot be performed simultaneously, resulting in operational issues and appointment cancellations.

## 4. Fake or malicious bookings blocking availability
Competitors or malicious users may create fake bookings, filling the schedule with non-existent clients and preventing real customers from booking available time slots.

## 5. Incorrect configuration of staff schedules
If an administrator configures staff availability incorrectly, clients may arrive for appointments when the specialist is not available, causing reputational damage and refund requests.
