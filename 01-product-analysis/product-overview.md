# Product Overview

EasyWeek is a web-based appointment booking system designed to automate the scheduling process for small and medium-sized service businesses.

The product reduces the workload on administrators by allowing clients to book appointments independently, without the need for phone calls or manual coordination. Service providers and business owners can manage their schedules in a centralized system and clearly see all upcoming appointments.

For clients, EasyWeek saves time and eliminates unnecessary communication. Users can view available time slots, compare them with their personal schedules, and book services online at a convenient time.
